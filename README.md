# calc_final
This repository contains the code for the calculus final project.
The code is for the skydiver falling project.
There are 4 parts to the code.
Parts 1-3 are simulations that are run by passing different arguments to the simulate function.
The simulate function will take those arguments and use them to run a simulation of the skydiver falling.
It will then graph the data and print information about relevant characteristics of the fall.
Part 4 is just some straightforward calculations with the equations of motion.
Each part can be run individually by calling the function associated with it, but by default they are set up to all run sequentially.
Note that if you run them sequentially, the next part will only start once you close the graphing window from the previous part.
